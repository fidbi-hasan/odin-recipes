        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hamburger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.</p>
        <p>Burgers sure are delicious and considering that 50 billion of them are consumed per year in our country, that means on average you eat one every 3 days. 60% of all sandwiches sold in the country are Burgers</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground chicken</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons blackened seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, chopped</li>
        </ul>
