# Project: Recipes
## The First Project of ***The Odin Project***

All things are done according to the assignment's instruction.

Initially, an index.html file was created. Then, other three pages named pasta (pasta.html), sandwich (sandwich.html) and burger (burger.html) were also created and linked to the Homepage (index.html) with the help of anchor tag. The homepage also contains a heading on top of the page.

Other than the Homepage, one of three images are used in each of those pages mentioned above with a heading on top. Then the description for the food, ingredients and steps are also written in sequence.

Except homepage, the other three pages are kept inside a seperate directory named 'pages'. All the images are also kept in 'images' directory.

All the contents of the site are collected from Google and Allrecipes.
